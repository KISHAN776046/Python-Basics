    "2. What is Exception Handling in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exception handling** in Python is a mechanism to handle runtime errors gracefully without crashing the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Keywords:\n",
    "- `try`: Block of code to test for errors.\n",
    "- `except`: Block to handle the error.\n",
    "- `else`: Block that runs if no error occurs.\n",
    "- `finally`: Block that runs no matter what (error or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "try:\n",
    "    x = 10 / 0\n",
    "except ZeroDivisionError:\n",
    "    print(\"Cannot divide by zero.\")\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print(\"No error occurred.\")\n",

    "\n",
    "Key Points:\n",
    "- Executes after `try` and `except` blocks.\n",
    "- Runs **regardless** of whether an exception was raised.\n",
    "- Useful for releasing resources (e.g., closing files or database connections).\n",
    " Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
